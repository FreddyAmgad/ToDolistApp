# ToDolistApp
## Description 
Our alarm clock app offers users a comprehensive and intuitive way to manage their alarms. The home screen prominently displays the current time and date, ensuring users are always aware of the current moment. Setting a new alarm is simple with an integrated time picker, allowing precise control over alarm times. Users can personalize their wake-up experience by selecting from a variety of alarm tones. The app also provides a convenient list of all set alarms, complete with on/off toggles for easy management. When an alarm rings, users can choose to snooze or dismiss it, offering flexibility in how they start their day. The app features a user-friendly and visually appealing design, making it both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
